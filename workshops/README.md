## How to Run

### Preparation

1. **Review** the workshop materials
2. **Customize** examples for your organization
3. **Prepare** handouts (templates from `/tools/templates/`)

### Facilitation Tips

- **Keep it interactive** — Pause for discussion every 10-15 minutes
- **Use real examples** — Replace generic examples with your organization's initiatives
- **Capture actions** — End with clear next steps
- **Follow up** — Schedule the next workshop or review

### Audience Recommendations

| Workshop | Who Should Attend |
|----------|-------------------|
| Why AI Fails | Anyone involved in AI decisions |
| Self-Assessment | AI leads, product owners, technical leads |
| Dashboard Setup | Technical implementers, AI ops |
