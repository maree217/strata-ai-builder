## Facilitator Guide

### Section 1: Welcome & Recap (5 min)

**Say:**
> "Last time we talked about why 95% of AI projects fail. Today we're going to find out where we stand — and what to do about it."

**Recap Key Points:**
- Three root causes: wrong sequence, project mentality, no visibility
- Solution: Three-Layer Architecture + Portfolio Intelligence
- Today: Assess our current state

---

### Section 2: Quick Assessment (5 min)

**Say:**
> "Before we do the full assessment, let's do a 60-second pulse check."

**Activity: Quick Assessment**

Display these questions:

| Question | Yes | No |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Can you list all your AI initiatives right now? | | |
| Do you know the ROI of each? | | |
| Do you review performance monthly? | | |

**Ask participants to vote (show of hands or poll).**

**Interpret:**
- Mostly Yes: "Great foundation — let's find the gaps"
- Mixed: "Typical — we have work to do"
- Mostly No: "That's why we're here"

---

### Section 3: Full Assessment (20 min)

**Activity: Section-by-Section Assessment**

Hand out or display the full assessment from [framework/assessment.md](../framework/assessment.md).

**For each section, read questions aloud and have participants score individually or as a group.**

**Section 1: Portfolio Visibility (5 min)**
- How many AI initiatives?
- What stage is each?
- Who owns each?

**Section 2: Layer 1 - Infrastructure (5 min)**
- Total AI spend visibility
- Monitoring in place
- Access controlled
- API calls logged

**Section 3: Layer 2 - Intelligence (5 min)**
- Data management
- Model versioning
- Rollback capability
- Learning loops

**Section 4: Layer 3 - Experience (3 min)**
- Adoption tracking
- Issue reporting
- Human override

**Section 5: Governance (2 min)**
- Risk classification
- Documentation
- Review frequency
- Bias testing

---

### Section 4: Gap Analysis (10 min)

**Activity: Calculate & Interpret Scores**

Have participants tally their scores:

| Section | Score | Max |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Portfolio Visibility | | 9 |
| Layer 1 | | 12 |
| Layer 2 | | 12 |
| Layer 3 | | 9 |
| Governance | | 12 |
| **Total** | | **54** |

**Interpret Total Score:**

| Score | Level | Message |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 45-54 | Optimizing | "You're in the top 5% — focus on refinement" |
| 35-44 | Established | "Good foundation — close specific gaps" |
| 25-34 | Developing | "Making progress — prioritize Layer 1" |
| 15-24 | Beginning | "Early stage — start with basics" |
| 0-14 | Ad Hoc | "High risk — immediate action needed" |

**Identify Lowest Section:**

> "Look at which section scored lowest. That's your highest priority."

**Discussion:**
> "What surprised you about your score? Where did you expect to be stronger?"

### Section 5: Action Planning (5 min)

**Activity: Define Next Steps**

Based on scores, assign actions:

**If Portfolio Visibility is lowest:**
- Action: Create AI initiative inventory this week
- Tool: AI Idea Canvas template

**If Layer 1 is lowest:**
- Action: Audit AI costs this week
- Read: Layer 1 Infrastructure guide

**If Layer 2 is lowest:**
- Action: Document data sources for one initiative
- Read: Layer 2 Intelligence guide

**If Layer 3 is lowest:**
- Action: Add feedback collection to one AI feature
- Read: Layer 3 Experience guide

**If Governance is lowest:**
- Action: Schedule first portfolio review
- Read: Governance guide

**Say:**
> "The next workshop is Dashboard Setup. That will give you the tool to track everything we discussed today."
