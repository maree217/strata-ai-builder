## Facilitator Guide

### Section 1: Welcome & Context (5 min)

**Say:**
> "Today we're going to talk about why AI projects fail — and it's not what you might think. We're not going to blame the technology or the vendors. We're going to look at patterns that organizations consistently get wrong, and how to fix them."

**Key Points:**
- This isn't about any specific project
- It's about organizational patterns
- The goal is learning, not blame

---

### Section 2: The Problem (10 min)

**Slide: The Statistic**

> "95% of AI projects fail to deliver expected business value."

**Discussion Prompt:**
> "Before I explain why, I want to hear from you. Based on your experience, why do you think AI projects fail?"

*Collect 3-5 responses. Common answers: bad data, wrong vendor, lack of skills, etc.*

**Say:**
> "Those are all valid challenges. But research consistently points to three root causes that underlie most failures."

**Slide: Root Cause 1 — Wrong Sequence**

```
What organizations do:
"Let's build a chatbot!" → Demo looks great → Costs explode → Project dies

What they should do:
Infrastructure first → Intelligence second → Experience last
```

> "Most projects start with the exciting part — the chatbot, the demo, the thing you can show the board. But without the foundation, it can't sustain."

**Slide: Root Cause 2 — Project Mentality**

```
What organizations do:
Start → Build → "Go live" → Team moves on → AI degrades

What they should do:
Start → Build → Deploy → Monitor → Iterate → Monitor → Iterate...
```

> "AI isn't like traditional IT. It doesn't have a 'done' date. Models drift. Costs change. Users evolve. If you treat AI like a project with an end, you're setting up for failure."

**Slide: Root Cause 3 — No Visibility**

> "Quick show of hands — how many of you could list every AI initiative in your organization right now?"

*Usually very few hands.*

> "That's typical. And it's dangerous. Without visibility, you get duplicate efforts, unknown costs, unmanaged risk, and no strategic alignment."

### Section 3: The Solution (10 min)

**Slide: Three-Layer Architecture**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           LAYER 3: EXPERIENCE                                │
│           What people see and use                            │
│           Build LAST                                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│           LAYER 2: INTELLIGENCE                              │
│           Learning, memory, decisions                        │
│           Build SECOND                                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│           LAYER 1: INFRASTRUCTURE                            │
│           Reliable, secure, cost-effective                   │
│           Build FIRST                                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Say:**
> "The organizations that succeed follow a different pattern. They build from the bottom up, not top down. Infrastructure first, then intelligence, then experiences."

**Key Points:**
- Layer 1 delivers 30-50% cost savings
- Layer 2 delivers 2-4x ROI
- Layer 3 delivers 5-10x ROI — but only when built on solid layers

**Slide: Portfolio Intelligence**

> "And they don't treat AI as projects. They treat it as a portfolio of capabilities that need continuous management — just like you'd manage an investment portfolio."

**Discussion Prompt:**
> "Think about your organization. Where do most AI initiatives start — Layer 1, 2, or 3?"

*Most will say Layer 3.*

> "That's the pattern we need to change."

### Section 4: Next Steps (5 min)

**Slide: What You Can Do**

1. **Inventory** — List all AI initiatives you know about
2. **Classify** — Which layer did each start at?
3. **Assess** — Can you answer the five portfolio questions?
4. **Join** — Attend the Self-Assessment workshop next week

**Say:**
> "This workshop was about awareness. The next workshop is about action — we'll assess where we actually are and start building visibility."

**Handout:** [Five Portfolio Questions](../philosophy/portfolio-intelligence.md)
