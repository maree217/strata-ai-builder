# Portfolio Intelligence

**How to MANAGE AI continuously — because AI never ends.**

---

## The Core Insight

> **AI is not a project you finish. It's a capability you operate.**

This single insight separates organizations that succeed with AI from those that don't.

---

## Traditional vs. Portfolio Thinking

### Traditional Project Thinking

```
"When will this AI project be done?"
"What's the final deliverable?"
"Let's close this out and move on."

Timeline:
Start → Build → Deploy → DONE ✓
```

**Result:** 95% failure rate. Projects "finish" but don't deliver sustained value.

### Portfolio Thinking

```
"How is this AI capability performing?"
"What's the ROI trend?"
"How do we improve it next quarter?"

Timeline:
Idea → Experiment → Deploy → Monitor → Iterate → Monitor → Iterate...
                              (never ends)
```

**Result:** AI that continuously improves and delivers compounding value.

## The Five Questions

Every organization should be able to answer these about their AI portfolio:

| Question | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| **1. How many AI initiatives do you have?** | You can't manage what you can't count |
| **2. What stage is each in?** | Different stages need different management |
| **3. What's the ROI of each?** | Resource allocation requires ROI visibility |
| **4. Who owns each?** | Accountability prevents orphaned initiatives |
| **5. When did you last review each?** | Active management requires regular review |

## Initiative Stages

### Stage 1: Idea

```
Status: Captured and prioritized
Owner: Business sponsor identified
Action: Evaluate feasibility
```

**Key Questions:**
- What problem does this solve?
- What's the expected value?
- What's the risk level?

### Stage 2: Experiment (Alpha)

```
Status: Proof of concept in progress
Owner: Technical lead + business sponsor
Action: Validate assumptions
```

**Key Questions:**
- Is the technology feasible?
- What's the actual cost?
- Does it solve the problem?

### Stage 3: Pilot (Beta)

```
Status: Limited production deployment
Owner: Product owner + operations
Action: Validate at scale
```

**Key Questions:**
- Does it work with real users?
- What's the actual ROI?
- What needs improvement?

### Stage 4: Production (Live)

```
Status: Full deployment
Owner: Operations team
Action: Monitor and iterate
```

**Key Questions:**
- Is it meeting targets?
- What's the trend?
- What's next?

### Stage 5: Sunset

```
Status: Scheduled for retirement
Owner: Operations + governance
Action: Graceful shutdown
```

**Key Questions:**
- Is there a replacement?
- Are dependencies handled?
- Is data archived properly?

## The Iteration Cycle

AI in production isn't "done." It's in continuous iteration.

   - At-risk initiatives: Action needed?

3. **Resource Allocation** (15 min)
   - Budget vs. actual
   - Team capacity
   - Investment priorities

4. **Compliance Check** (10 min)
   - Documentation status
   - Audit findings
   - Upcoming requirements

5. **Decisions** (5 min)
   - New initiatives approved
   - Initiatives to sunset
   - Resource reallocations

---

## Common Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern 1: "Set and Forget"

**Symptom:** AI deployed and never reviewed
**Result:** Degrading performance, cost overruns, compliance drift
**Fix:** Monthly portfolio reviews

### Anti-Pattern 2: "Shadow AI"

**Symptom:** Initiatives running without visibility
**Result:** Unknown risk exposure, duplicate efforts, wasted spend
**Fix:** Central portfolio tracking

### Anti-Pattern 3: "Zombie Initiatives"

**Symptom:** Projects neither active nor closed
**Result:** Resource drain, confusion, technical debt
**Fix:** Clear stage gates and sunset process

### Anti-Pattern 4: "Hero Dependency"

**Symptom:** One person knows everything about an initiative
**Result:** Key-person risk, knowledge silos
**Fix:** Documented ownership and knowledge transfer

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Inventory

Create a single list of all AI initiatives.

```markdown
| ID | Name | Stage | Owner | Last Review |
|----|------|-------|-------|-------------|
| AI-001 | Customer Chatbot | Live | Jane Smith | 2024-12-01 |
| AI-002 | Document Parser | Beta | John Doe | 2024-11-15 |
```

### Step 2: Classify

Assign stage and risk level to each.

### Step 3: Track

Use the Strata Dashboard or templates to maintain visibility.

### Step 4: Review

Schedule monthly portfolio reviews.

### Step 5: Iterate

Continuously improve based on data.
