# Why 95% of AI Projects Fail

**The problem Strata solves — and why your organization is probably making these mistakes.**

---

## The Statistic

> **95% of AI projects fail to deliver expected business value.**

This isn't pessimism. It's research:
- Gartner: 85% of AI projects fail to deliver
- MIT Sloan: Only 10% of companies see significant financial benefit
- McKinsey: Most AI pilots never reach production

## The Three Root Causes

After analyzing hundreds of AI implementations, the failures cluster into three patterns:

### 1. Wrong Sequence

**The Pattern:**
```
"Let's build a chatbot!" → Demo looks great → Costs explode → Project dies
```

**Why It Fails:**

Organizations start with Layer 3 (the visible experience) without Layer 1 (infrastructure) or Layer 2 (intelligence).

```
What they build:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 3: Chatbot  ← Started here       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 2: ???      ← Missing            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 1: ???      ← Missing            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Result:**
- No cost visibility → budget overruns
- No monitoring → silent failures
- No learning loops → static, degrading quality
- No governance → compliance risk

**The Fix:** [Three-Layer Architecture](./three-layer-architecture.md)

### 2. Project Mentality

**The Pattern:**
```
AI initiative starts → Team builds → "Go live" → Team moves on → AI degrades
```

**Why It Fails:**

AI is treated like traditional IT projects with a "done" date. But AI systems:
- Degrade over time (model drift)
- Need continuous improvement (learning loops)
- Require ongoing monitoring (performance, cost, quality)
- Have evolving compliance requirements

```
Traditional Project:
Start ─────────────────────────────▶ DONE ✓

AI Reality:
Start ──▶ Deploy ──▶ Monitor ──▶ Iterate ──▶ Monitor ──▶ Iterate...
                                    (never ends)
```

**Result:**
- "Successful" launches that fail within 6 months
- Models that get worse over time
- No one responsible for ongoing health
- Orphaned AI systems

**The Fix:** [Portfolio Intelligence](./portfolio-intelligence.md)

---

### 3. No Visibility

**The Pattern:**
```
Multiple teams build AI → No central tracking → Duplicate efforts → Shadow AI → Risk exposure
```

**Why It Fails:**

Without portfolio visibility, organizations can't answer basic questions:
- How many AI initiatives do we have?
- What's the total cost?
- Which ones are delivering value?
- What's our risk exposure?

**Result:**
- Duplicate initiatives (team A builds what team B already built)
- Unknown costs (AI spend buried in cloud bills)
- Unmanaged risk (no one knows what's running)
- No strategic alignment (random experiments vs. coordinated capability)

## The Warning Signs

### You Might Be in the 95% If...

**Infrastructure (Layer 1) Warning Signs:**
- [ ] "We don't know how much AI costs us"
- [ ] "Our AI calls keep failing with no warning"
- [ ] "We don't know who's using our AI systems"
- [ ] "Our cloud bill keeps surprising us"

**Intelligence (Layer 2) Warning Signs:**
- [ ] "Our AI gives different answers each time"
- [ ] "We have to retrain models manually"
- [ ] "There's no way to roll back when things break"
- [ ] "Our AI doesn't learn from corrections"

**Experience (Layer 3) Warning Signs:**
- [ ] "Users don't trust our AI tools"
- [ ] "The chatbot is slow and expensive"
- [ ] "We built a demo but can't scale it"
- [ ] "Adoption is lower than expected"

**Portfolio Warning Signs:**
- [ ] "We don't know how many AI projects we have"
- [ ] "Different teams are building the same thing"
- [ ] "No one reviews AI performance regularly"
- [ ] "We have AI systems no one maintains"

**Count your checkmarks:**
- 0-3: Minor issues, addressable
- 4-7: Significant gaps, prioritize fixes
- 8-12: High risk of failure, urgent action needed
- 13+: Already failing, restructure required

## The Cost of Failure

### Direct Costs

| Cost Type | Typical Range |
|-----------|---------------|
| Wasted AI spend | £100K - £1M per failed initiative |
| Opportunity cost | 6-18 months of delayed value |
| Rework cost | 3-5x original budget |
| Compliance penalties | £10K - £10M+ (GDPR, EU AI Act) |

### Indirect Costs

| Cost Type | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Lost trust | "AI doesn't work here" mentality |
| Talent exodus | Good people leave frustrated organizations |
| Competitive disadvantage | Competitors succeed while you restart |
| Strategic debt | Further behind with each failure |

---

## Why It's Fixable

The 5% that succeed aren't smarter or better funded. They:

1. **Build in the right sequence**
   - Layer 1 first (infrastructure)
   - Layer 2 second (intelligence)
   - Layer 3 last (experience)

2. **Manage AI as capability, not project**
   - Continuous monitoring
   - Regular iteration
   - Never "done"

3. **Maintain portfolio visibility**
   - All initiatives tracked
   - Costs visible
   - Risk managed

**Strata codifies these patterns** into a framework anyone can follow.

## The Bottom Line

**95% failure isn't inevitable.** It's the result of predictable, avoidable mistakes.

Strata exists because:
- The patterns of failure are known
- The patterns of success are known
- There was no single framework combining both

**You don't have to be in the 95%.**

*Stop failing the predictable way. Start succeeding the systematic way.*
