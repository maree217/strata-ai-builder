# Philosophy

**The "why" behind Strata — understanding the approach before using the tools.**

## Two Core Philosophies

Strata is built on two foundational insights about why AI initiatives succeed or fail:

### 1. Three-Layer Architecture
*How to BUILD AI correctly*

Most AI projects fail because they start with the wrong layer. Organizations jump to chatbots and demos (Layer 3) without building the infrastructure (Layer 1) or intelligence (Layer 2) to support them.

**The sequence matters:**
```
Layer 1: Infrastructure  →  Build FIRST   →  30-50% cost savings
Layer 2: Intelligence    →  Build SECOND  →  2-4x ROI
Layer 3: Experience      →  Build LAST    →  5-10x ROI
+ Governance throughout
```

### 2. Portfolio Intelligence
*How to MANAGE AI continuously*

AI isn't a project you finish. It's a capability you operate. Organizations that treat AI like traditional IT projects — with a "done" date — consistently fail.

**The continuous loop:**
```
Idea → Experiment → Deploy → Monitor → Iterate → Monitor → Iterate...
                              (never ends)
```

## Research Basis

Strata synthesizes insights from:

- **Gartner AI Maturity Model** — Phases of AI adoption
- **McKinsey Strategic AI Framework** — Value creation patterns
- **MIT CISR Enterprise AI Research** — Organizational capabilities
- **IBM AI Operating Model** — Operational patterns
- **Microsoft AI Transformation Journey** — Implementation sequences

What Strata adds:
- **Business language** instead of technical jargon
- **Clear sequencing** with layer dependencies
- **ROI focus** where each layer funds the next
- **Practical tools** not just theory

## Next Steps

After understanding the philosophy:

1. **Assess your current state** → [Framework Assessment](../framework/assessment.md)
2. **Start implementing** → [Framework Guide](../framework/README.md)
3. **Get tools** → [Dashboard & Templates](../tools/README.md)

*Philosophy without implementation is just theory. Strata gives you both.*
